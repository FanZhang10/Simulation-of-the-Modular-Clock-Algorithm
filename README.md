# Simulation-of-the-Modular-Clock-Algorithm
Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have emerged as advanced and promising paradigm to exploit the existing wireless spectrum opportunistically. It is crucial for users in CRNs to search for neighbors via rendezvous process and thereby establish the communication links to exchange the information necessary for spectrum management and channel contention, etc. Underuse of the regulated radio spectrum is being addressed using a cognitive radio network approach termed dynamic spectrum access. Primary users always have priority, Secondary users only can use residual air time when primary users not active. The application is simulated to make two secondary users rendezvous in minimizing time required by 3 different algorithms, which are random rendezvous algorithm, jump-stay rendezvous algorithm, and modular clock algorithms. And the output for the application are two sequences of channels, which is calculated by one of those 3 algorithms. Then we use the results which generated by the application to analysis how those 3 algorithm.  Especially, we major focus on the revisiting the performance of modular clock algorithms for blind rendezvous in CRN. The random channel algorithm which visits all channels in a random order. And for each time slot, a channel is selected with uniform probability. The jump-stay rendezvous algorithm is designed for multiple synchronous users with guaranteed rendezvous in one round. The Modular Clock Algorithm, which inspired the creation of the jump-stay rendezvous algorithm, proceeds in rounds. Each round consists of scanning twice a block of generated channels. Let m be the number of channels. Theis et alâ€™s analysis the modular clock algorithm of maximum time to rendezvous is a bit larger than 2p time slot, where p is the smallest prime number greater than m.  We want to show that the expected time to rendezvous (ETTR) of the modular clock algorithms is no more than 3p/4 time slots.
